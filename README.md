# Batch-Stain-Deconvolution
Color deconvolution in MATLAB with support for parallel processing and GPU accelerated deconvolution

I haven't used this in years, since QuPath can do this much more efficiently, but it's a useful reference for those looking to implement their own methods of deconvolution

Also, I no longer have a MATLAB license, so I can't provide much support in terms of debugging the script.
