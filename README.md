# Batch-Stain-Deconvolution
Color deconvolution in MATLAB with support for parallel processing and GPU accelerated deconvolution

I haven't used this in years, since QuPath can do this much more efficiently, but it's a useful reference for those looking to implement their own methods of deconvolution
